# npm resolution error report

While resolving: oiac2@0.0.1
Found: react@18.3.1
node_modules/react
  react@"^18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^19.1.0" from decap-cms-app@3.9.0
node_modules/decap-cms-app
  decap-cms-app@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
