# npm resolution error report

While resolving: oiac2@0.0.1
Found: astro@3.6.5
node_modules/astro
  astro@"^3.4.3" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer astro@"^5.0.0" from @astrojs/vercel@8.2.7
node_modules/@astrojs/vercel
  @astrojs/vercel@"8.2.7" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
